**How it works**
------
**1)** Create a new branch for every issue and note down what was tried and what worked to fix it.

**2)** Merge that branch into the folder for that issue and give it the name of the user and date. Example: [DATE]-[USER]

**3)** Add fix that worked for them at the top of the file in bold/underlined

**4)** Delete the old branch.

## **ONLY ADD TECH ISSUE FOLDERS. ACCOUNT ISSUES ARE NOT WORTH ADDING.**
