# **FIX THAT WORKED: Could not find fix, got stuck on dxdiag stage**

Steps tried:
1) Asked for launcher_log.txt
2) Asked if they have two monitors plugged in due to [this](https://github.com/jrbudda/minecrift/issues/323)
3) Asked for [win/dxdiag](https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/zsDxDw6VCw/) due to opengl errors in [log](https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/wJBqvm27nt/)
