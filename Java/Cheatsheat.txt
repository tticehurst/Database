// Public - This makes the main method public which means we can call the method from outside the class.
// Static - We do not need to create object for static methods to run. They can run itself.
// Void - It does not return anything.
// Main - It is the method name. This is the entry point method from which the JVM can run your program.
// (String[] args) - Used for command line arguments that are passed as strings.

// data_type variable_name = value;
// static int to print integer
// static char to print character
// System.out.printf("Number = %s\nChar = %s", num, ch); - Allows printing of multiple variables
// Static variables are also known as class variables
// public static String - Type of variable is 'string'
// Three types of variables - Local variables, Static (class) variables and instance variables
// Changes to a static variable will apply to all static variables. A change to static variables will change all static variablesa
// Unlike static variables, a change to instance variables won't change all instance variables
// Local variables can only be accessed in that method
