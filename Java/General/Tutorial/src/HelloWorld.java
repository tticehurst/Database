// Public - This makes the main method public which means we can call the method from outside the class.
// Static - We do not need to create object for static methods to run. They can run itself.
// Void - It does not return anything.
// Main - It is the method name. This is the entry point method from which the JVM can run your program.
// (String[] args) - Used for command line arguments that are passed as strings.
